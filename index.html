            <p> Welcome to the page. This page is inspired by my interest and love for horses. I hope you leran a little bit about horses and find interest in them too.</p>
            <p>Horses are amazing and beautiful creatures. Wild horese are scared of all animals (except  thier own kind)  because horses
         are prey. Human tamed horses are gentle and caring but if a horse was treated badly by humans in the past
       (such as being beaten)  it might lash out at a human. Or if a mare is pregnant or protecting a foal then the horse might also
          lash out at a human.</p>
            <p>Horses are swift as eagles and their fur is softer than a puppy's fur.
          They are as smart  an ape and can be as fierce as a lion when protecting themselves.
           They are as loving to a friend of thier own kind as if they were eachothers spouse and as friendly to children as if
                the child was thier own foal. Horses have personalities just like humans and are wonderful for disabled children.
                Horses are powerful and can severely break bones when biting and kicking, but only use this power if they have no
                escape and are in danger.
