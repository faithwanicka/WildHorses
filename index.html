        <p>Horses are amazing and beautiful creatures. Wild horese are scared of all animals (except  thier own kind)  because they
         are prey. Human tamed horses are gentle and caring but if the horse was treated badly by humans in the past
         (such as being beaten) or if a mare  has a foal, or a colt, or is pregnant then the horse might lash out at a human.</p>
        <p>Horses are swift as eagles and their fur is softer than a puppy's (not a wired haired haired one though). 
          They are as smart  an ape and can be as fierce as a lion when protecting themselves.
