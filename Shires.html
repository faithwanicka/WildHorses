            <p>Shires, a breed of horse,  is a draft horse. Draft horses are thick boned, strong, and tall. Shires have a long,
           lean head and a slightly roman nose; long, arched, upright neck, deep sloping shoulders, and a broad chest; a deep girth,
           short back, and sloping croup;  they also have large hooves. They can be black, brown, bay ( a blackish brown color), gray,
           and chestnut; they can also have some white facial and leg markings. Shires are best suited for farm work, logging, and
           pulling carriages or wagons. They originate from England and have special qualities such as being the tallest of the
           draft breeds and heaviest after the Brabant plus having very heavy feathering ( feathers are extra long fur around thier
           hooves). Shires descend from the heavy horse used by the armies of King Henry II ( 1154-1189 ). Its lush feathering was
           developed to protect its legs from the wet and muddy conditions of the English contryside.</p>
